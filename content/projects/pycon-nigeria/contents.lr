description:

This is the first time a Python community event of this level will be taking place in Nigeria. As it is much anticipated, it is expected to attract more than 200 professional, enthusiasts and student delegates, from Nigeria and around the world, to learn about the latest developments and best practices in the Python ecosystem. Unlike many developer conferences, PyCon Nigeria is a not-for-profit conference, run entirely by volunteers dedicated to growing the Python developer community in Nigeria
